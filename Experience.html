    <h2>Intern-Technical Support May 2023 to September 2023</h2>
    <p>During my on-the-job training experience as a site support intern, I learned a lot. In 
      terms of personal growth and professional development, I was also able to learn new 
      things. In terms of attitude, I was able to change from being a procrastinator to an early 
      bird. I am up as early as the other employees. I have learned to manage my time 
      properly and stick to deadlines.
      Even though I do a lot of assessments at school, not only at school but also at home, I 
      still manage my time. When there was a problem with the portal, or e2m, they showed 
      me how to solve it, and they also gave me hands-on experience most of the time. 
      Especially in the configuration and account creation of examiners so that all new 
      computers can be deployed in their designated section.

    <h2>Information Technology-Technical Support</h2>
    <p>I was one of the technical Support and I learned how to fix the Lan cable per department. And I help my 
      colleagues with paperwork in the IT Department.
      We segregate wires in the department to be systematic when picking up and returning devices.
      We were also taught to configure an IP address and computer and we also memorized many passwords 
      of each department.
